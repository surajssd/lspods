# Programming Kubernetes

Here are example code which helps you build the understanding of the Kubernetes Programming. This code uses the library `client-go` to talk to the Kubernetes. The code walks you through the process of creating a bespoke Kubernetes client application.

The code is divided into multiple branches with incremental additions.

This repo is inspired from the code about listing pods here: https://github.com/hrishin/lunchnlearn/tree/master/lspods

## Get this code

```
git clone https://github.com/surajssd/lspods.git
cd lspods/
```

## Using this code

```

Similarly change the branches increasing the steps.
